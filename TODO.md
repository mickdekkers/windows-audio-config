## TODO

FIXME: you can't mix MME and KS repeaters (because KS takes exclusive control) even though KS kinda works if you start MME first. Switch entirely to MME?
- Figure out how to record the audio of one of the virtual cables with e.g. Audacity. I think KS takes exclusive control, so this may not actually work with the KS repeater and we may have to switch to the MME repeater.
- Configure Shadowplay for instant replay recording and document configuration
- Configure OBS and document configuration
- Document Tracktion Waveform configuration for guitar effects
- Document soundboard configuration
- Document how to forward media audio to chat output (for "mic spamming" in online games)
