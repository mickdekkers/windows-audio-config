FIXME: check if audio distortions are fixed

- Check whether the Windows listen feature (on recording devices in sound settings) can replace VAC repeaters https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/manual/glossary.htm#ListenFeature
- Figure out how to record the audio of one of the virtual cables with e.g. Audacity. I think KS takes exclusive control, so this may not actually work with the KS repeater and we may have to switch to the MME repeater.
- Configure Shadowplay for instant replay recording and document configuration
- Configure OBS and document configuration
- Document Soundpad configuration
